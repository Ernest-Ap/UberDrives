### Cary was the most popular start 201 times and stop 203 times point for these Uber drivers. Most frequent route taken by Uber drivers was from Cary to Morrisville 52 times.  All start trips from San Francisco were business related. 
### Purpose trips of meetings, customer visits and meal/entertain being the most miles covered. These being the most trips makes sense. The reasons depending on location, if it’s business related there could be meetings at other external offices. Customer visits if you’re for e.g. an independent business owner and are going to visit a customer to work on a project in their location. Meal/entertain trips which is popular among most age groups using Uber for this reason. The proportion of business trips is 94.12% the majority of trips was business related. Minority of these Uber trips were of personal use at 5.88%.
